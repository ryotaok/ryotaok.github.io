# Kokomi (HP scale)

Kokomi (HP scale) is the **5th** position on average out of 43
characters when full energy is given at the beginning, and is the
**3rd** position on average when 20 energy is given at the
beginning. See [Simulation Settings](./simulation_settings.md) for more
information.

The following tables show relative strength of the available weapons and
artifacts. The columns of "5s", "10s" and "20s" are obtained by
simulating max damage of the weapons and artifacts at a particular
moment.
